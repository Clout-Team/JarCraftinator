JARCraftinator (soon to be christened Verdigris) is a Minecraft server software written from scratch (no more NMS wrappers!)

## Development
### Basic Game Features
These are roughly in the order in which we will work on the code base, although we may make some changes.  
:heavy_check_mark: = Completed | :hourglass_flowing_sand: = In Development

- ~~Server favicon, color MOTD~~ :heavy_check_mark:
- ~~Keepalive~~ :heavy_check_mark:
- Packet API :hourglass_flowing_sand:
- Plugin API :hourglass_flowing_sand:
- World generation
- World saves
- Packet encryption
- Packet compression
- The entire Play protocol
  - Players
- Mojang Authentication
- Mobs, AI and API
  - Entities
  - Pathfinding & Pathfinding API
- Multiple Worlds

### Development Goals
- Protocol API that will not break on updates
- Protocol API that can be used without reflection
- Revolutionary plugin development options
- Custom, more efficient, world save format
- Potentially: a web panel to manage your server

### Other cool plans
- A parser for [wiki.vg](http://wiki.vg/) to automatically update the protocol to the latest version.

## Running
### Setup Guide
We will write this when we have something playable.

### Plugins
The plugin API has not yet been implemented.
